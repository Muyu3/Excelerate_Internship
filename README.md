## 🚀 Project Phases and Key Tasks

The project workflow was divided into three distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Data Preparation and Auditing

* **Tool Familiarization:** Gained practical experience with Excelerate's primary data visualization and analytical platforms.
* **Outreach Data Auditing:** Conducted a comprehensive audit of existing outreach data sources.
    * **Data Quality Assessment:** Ensured accuracy, completeness, and consistency across datasets.
    * **Data Cleaning & ETL:** Performed necessary data cleaning, transformation, and structuring to prepare raw data for analysis (ETL process).

### Phase 2: Analysis and Dashboard Design

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Executed deep-dive analysis on processed data to uncover key **trends, patterns, and anomalies**.
    * Focused on identifying primary drivers of outreach success and pinpointing operational inefficiencies.
